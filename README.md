# JTanks Game

JTanks is a Java-designed video game where players control a tank and engage in combat with other entities. The game was created entirely from scratch over the course of two months and comprises over 5,000 lines of code.

## Project Overview

JTanks is an action-packed game that features user-controlled agents (tanks) engaging in battles with various enemies. The game includes several key features and components:

1. **Game Design**: The game was designed to provide an engaging and challenging experience for players. It includes various levels, enemy types, and power-ups to keep the gameplay interesting.

2. **Game Mechanics**: The core mechanics involve controlling a tank, navigating the game environment, and using various weapons and strategies to defeat enemies.

3. **Custom Engine**: JTanks was built using a custom game engine designed specifically for this project. This engine handles graphics rendering, collision detection, and game logic.

## Features

- **User-Controlled Agent**: Players can control their tank using keyboard inputs, maneuvering through the game environment and engaging in combat.
- **Enemy Entities**: The game features various types of enemies with different behaviors and attack patterns.
- **Power-Ups**: Players can collect power-ups to enhance their tank's abilities, such as increased firepower or speed.
- **Levels**: Multiple levels with increasing difficulty provide a challenging experience for players.

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**: The game initializes by loading resources, setting up the game environment, and preparing the initial state of the player and enemies.

2. **Game Loop**: The main game loop handles user input, updates the game state, renders graphics, and checks for collisions. This loop runs continuously to keep the game running smoothly.

3. **Collision Detection**: The custom engine includes an efficient collision detection system to handle interactions between the player, enemies, and the environment.

4. **Rendering**: The game uses Java's graphics capabilities to render the game environment, player, and enemies. It ensures smooth and visually appealing graphics.

## Results

JTanks showcases the capabilities of Java for game development and demonstrates effective use of custom-built engines for game mechanics. The key achievements include:

- **Engaging Gameplay**: The game provides an exciting and challenging experience for players, with smooth controls and responsive mechanics.
- **Efficient Engine**: The custom engine handles game logic, rendering, and collision detection efficiently, ensuring a seamless gaming experience.
- **Comprehensive Design**: Over 5,000 lines of code encompass a well-structured and modular design, making the game robust and maintainable.
